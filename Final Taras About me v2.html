      <h3>My Goal</h3>
      <p>
        I want to make it to class on time and join the Humber esports league of
        legends team and surely graduate and reach all my professors expections
        and maybe, just maybe try to surpass them and make lots of friends and
        connections with everyone in the humber community. I truly believe if we
        can all work eachother and help eachother reach our goals we will
        succeed and move on to even bigger ones!
